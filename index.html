        I am Rajesh Maharjan from Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. I am calm and relaxed
        person. I have a lot of interest in Chwali arts and have been involving
        in arts since last seventeen years. It is my own creation as I have not
        learned about it from anybody so I am inspired by myself. Talking about
        Chwali, it is a part of wheat plant called stems.Once farmers harvest
        the plant, they will dried the stems and will used for thatching roofs.
        And Chwali artists will utilize it which also helps to prevent it from
        going to waste. The colour of dried stems are light golden shimmering so
        the art of Chwali looks more attractive. Straw painting are craft
        objects made by shaping straw into the paterns and represntaional
        images. Wheat-straw is a very specific art of weaving straw into
        pictures by using and combining the nature. Chhwali craft in nepal is a
        unique approach to transform craft at a new level. Most straw artist
        used the method of cutting straw and finishing the design. My craft on
        the other hand is focused on painting the straw itself and giving the
        design. Most probably this is the first time in nepal anybody has used
        this technique of chhwali craft. My workshop is situated at kathmandu.
