          I am Rajesh Maharjan from Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. I am calm and
          relaxed person. I have a lot of interest in Chwali arts and have been
          involving in arts since last seventeen years. It is my own creation as
          I have not learned about it from anybody so I am inspired by myself.
          Talking about Chwali, it is a part of wheat plant called stems.Once
          farmers harvest the plant, they will dried the stems and will used for
          thatching roofs. And Chwali artists will utilize it which also helps
          to prevent it from going to waste. The colour of dried stems are light
          golden shimmering so the art of Chwali looks more attractive. Straw
          painting are craft objects made by shaping straw into the paterns and
          represntaional images. Wheat-straw is a very specific art of weaving
          straw into pictures by using and combining the nature. Chhwali craft
          in nepal is a unique approach to transform craft at a new level. Most
          straw artist used the method of cutting straw and finishing the
          design. My craft on the other hand is focused on painting the straw
          itself and giving the design. Most probably this is the first time in
          nepal anybody has used this technique of chhwali craft. My workshop is
          situated at kathmandu.
